# Please note!

While we are excited that you have a pull request for the Vulnrichment project, please note
the [README](https://github.com/cisagov/vulnrichment?tab=readme-ov-file#issues-and-pull-requests)
guidance on PRs: If your PR is proposing changes to a CVE ADP record directly, it is unlikely to
be merged directly due to the way we build the ADP containers. We will definitely use your code
as a guide, but you may not see an actual merge, or that merge will be overwritten later.

In a related vein, if your PR is an attempt to update a CVE record *outside* of the CISA-ADP
container, it will almost certainly be rejected. No offense intended, but if you have an
issue with a CVE record, the best place to deal with that is at [MITRE](https://cveform.mitre.org)
directly.

If your PR is anything other than an edit to a CVE record (such as documentation or examples),
we're able to handle it as a typical pull request.

Finally, please make sure to describe what you intend to accomplish with your PR. That way
we can assess it and make any suggestions to further your goals.

Thanks for your interest in Vulnrichment!
